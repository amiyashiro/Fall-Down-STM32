One of the technical challenges I encountered was getting the speed
of the ball correct. I had to change many times how many pixels the ball moves
by depending on what the tilt of the board is. Another problem I had was
increasing the speed the floors move up after a certain amount of time. The
problem was that the delay between each cycle was not big enough to make
a difference just by decreasing the delay. After a certain amount of time,
the floors move up by 2 pixels instead of 1. This speeds up the floors a bit
too much, but using a big delay while moving up 2 pixels causes choppy gameplay.

If I could do things differently, I would change the way the floors are drawn.
By drawing only the section that the floors move up, the gameplay may have been
smoother. I also would have spent more time trying to get the ball to roll
more smoothly. Lastly, I would have liked to implement a way to keep track of
scores on the SD card.
