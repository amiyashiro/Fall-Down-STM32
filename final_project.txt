For the final project I made a game called Fall Down. The point of the game
is to keep the ball from reaching the top of the screen. There are a series
of levels or floors that scroll up. Each floor has a hole for the ball to
fall into. The ball rolls according to the tilt of the board. After a certain
amount of time, the speed that the floors scroll up increases. 

Each floor is an instance of a struct and to keep track of them, they are 
stored in a queue. The holes in each floor are generated randomly. To keep
track of the floors they are stored in a queue. After a floor leaves the screen
the floor is popped off of the queue. Once there is a certain gap between the
bottom floor and the bottom of the screen a floor is pushed on the queue. The
ball is also a struct. Each cycle, data is taken from the board's accelerometer
and the ball's speed is updated. The speed of the ball is how many pixels it
moves each cycle. Every cycle both the floors and the ball are redrawn.
